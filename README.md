A Python script that scans folders for czech subtitle files, tries to decode their encoding and converts them into UTF-8. It creates backups and overwrites the originals, so no further action is necessary.

Modify directory_to_scan = "/PATH/TO/YOUR/FILES". The script expects the subs to have .cs. in filename, you can modify this to your liking as well.
